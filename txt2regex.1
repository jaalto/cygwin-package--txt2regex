to launch the default interactive interface.

.SH DETAILS
.P
\fB\-\-all\fR is cool but requires lots of lines (~35)

.P
\fB\-\-nocolor\fR is strong, so it kills \-\-whitebg

.P
\fB\-\-showmeta\fR rules, try it

.P
\fB\-\-showinfo\fR uses reverse video output, \-\-nocolor turns it off

.P
\fB\-\-history\fR is getting useful, stay tunned

\fB\-\-make\fR is a remedy for headaches

.P
\fB\-\-prog\fR is nice to use your favorite programs, mix it with \-\-make and \-\-history
